To mount existing crds cache test data into a running container, place the folders inside here.

crds-cache-default-test
crds-cache-test

Set DOWNLOAD=0 to skip downloading crds-cache-test from github
Set SYNC=0 to skip syncing crds-cache-default-test

You can also overwrite these from within the container by running:
$ CACHE_SRC=cache_volumes
$ DOWNLOAD=1
$ SYNC=1
$ sh scripts/sync-test-cache $CACHE_SRC $DOWNLOAD $SYNC

----

The API-testing folder contains a jupyter-notebook with some starter code for doing additional custom tests/troubleshooting for things like reference file submissions. With cache_volumes mounted in the container, any files you add to it while the container is running will be accessible to the notebook.
